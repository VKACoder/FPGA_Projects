This repo contains the Verilog and constraint files for the projects Iâ€™ve worked on using the Basys 3 FPGA board.
Uptil now, the repo contains two main folders -> Combinational and Sequential and the folders contains the respective designs as another folder (Example: Ripple Carry Adder).
Each design folder, contains the verilog and constraint files along with the diagrams.
